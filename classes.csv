Fire_severity§Fire severity generally indicates the degree of environmental change caused by fire [92,118]. Scott and Reinhardt [121] provide a slightly more detailed definition: the effect of a fire on ecosystem properties, usually described by the degree of soil heating or mortality of vegetation. Terms describing levels of fire severity can be very confusing. While terms from different sources may be similar in meaning, none are exactly equivalent. If you try to make them so, you will surely get a headache. It is best, when trying to describe levels of severity, to use terms from one source. As of 2018, three main sources describing fire severity levels were in use:  1) As used in the Interagency Fire Regime Condition Class (FRCC) Guidebook version 3.0, fire severity refers to "the effect of fire in terms of upper layer canopy replacement." "Replacement" is sometimes referred to as "top-kill" by LANDFIRE, although the FRCC guidebook states "Replacement may or may not cause a lethal effect on the plants. For example, replacement fire in grassland simply removes the leaves, which usually resprout from the basal crown, whereas replacement fire in most conifers causes total tree mortality." The FRCC guidebook classifies levels of fire severity as low, mixed, and replacement [9]: No fire effects:: <5% Replacement of upper canopy layer Low (previously called “surface”): 6%-25% Replacement of upper canopy layer Mixed: 26%-75% Replacement of upper canopy layer Replacement: >75% Replacement of upper canopy layer  In the past, the LANDFIRE Rapid Assessment [74] used surface severity to mean the same thing as low severity. Also in the past, mixed severity was occasionally used to describe mosaic fires (http://www.landfire.gov/veg_notification1.php).  2) Parsons et al. [99] use soil burn severity and vegetation burn severity to distinguish fire effects on these two entities.  3) The first 2 volumes of the Wildland Fire in Ecosystems series use understory fire to describe fires in forests and woodlands that have minimal effects on the overstory, and they contrast understory fire with stand-replacement fire. According to this classification, shrublands and grasslands experience only stand-replacement fire [20,122].  Two other levels of fire severity, moderate and high, are widely used in the literature, but their definitions vary, and they are not defined in the three classifications described above.  More quantitative definitions of fire severity include the product of fire intensity and residence time [2,83,117] and the amount of aboveground and belowground organic matter consumption from fire [63]. Jain et al. [58] recommend that it be defined and the measurement method explained whenever it is used quantitatively.§[Fire_characteristic]§[Low, Mixed, No_fire_effects, Replacement]§['https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/glossary2.html', 'http://cerrado.linkeddata.es/ecology/fire#FireSeverity']

Active_crown_fire§A crown fire in which the entire fuel complex is involved in flame, but the crowning phase remains dependent on heat released from surface fuel for continued spread. An active crown fire may also be also called a running crown fire or continuous crown fire. An active crown fire presents a solid wall of flame from the surface through the canopy fuel layers. Flames appear to emanate from the canopy as a whole rather than from individual trees within the canopy. Active crown fire is one of several types of crown fire and is contrasted with passive crown fires which are less vigorous types of crown fire that do not emit continuous, solid flames from the canopy§[Crown_fire]§[]§['https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/glossary2.html']

Passive_crown_fire§A type of crown fire in which the crowns of individual trees or small groups of trees burn, but solid flaming in the canopy cannot be maintained except for short periods. Passive crown fire encompasses a wide range of crown fire behavior, from occasional torching of isolated trees to nearly active crown fire. Passive crown fire is also called torching or candling. A fire in the crowns of the trees in which trees or groups of trees torch, ignited by the passing front of the fire.

Wooded_shrubland§A formation dominated by woody species, in which the proportion of shrubs is generally greater than the proportion of trees [112]. Grass and bare ground are usually present but not required for defining this formation. Compare with grassland, shrubland, wooded shrubland, savanna, forest.§[Biodiversity_index]§[]§['https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/glossary2.html#WoodedShrubland']
Woodland§A formation in which tree cover is greater than shrub cover, but the canopy is not closed [112]. Generally, overstory trees are >16 feet (5 m) tall and have 25% to 60% cover [75]. When describing woodlands, use of a dash indicates an overstory/understory relationship (e.g., bur oak/big bluestem woodland). Compare with grassland, shrubland, wooded shrubland, savanna, forest.§[Biodiversity_index]§[]§['https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/glossary2.html#woodland']
